### **Overview**  
This project focused on centralizing data into a data warehouse for efficient querying and reporting through automated ETL processes.

### **ETL Processes**  
Utilizing **Teradata BTEQ** and **Teradata FastLoad**, the ETL processes included:  
- **Data Cleansing**: Removing duplicates and correcting inconsistencies to ensure data quality.  
- **Transformation**: Applying business rules to convert raw data into structured and usable information.  
- **Data Loading**: Efficiently loading the transformed data into the data warehouse.

### **ETL Implementation**  
- Implemented a **pre-existing normalized schema** for effective data storage and retrieval.  
- Loaded and transformed raw CSV data into the warehouse, ensuring alignment with the schema and business rules.  
- Used **Teradata FastLoad** for fast data ingestion and validated data integrity throughout the process.

## Technologies Used  
- **Teradata Studio**: An administration toolkit that helps users to create and administer database objects.
- **Teradata BTEQ**: Core ETL scripting tool for data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
- **Teradata FastLoad**: Specialized utility for rapid loading of large datasets into the database.
