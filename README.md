## Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive data warehousing project focused on the design, implementation, and maintenance of a robust data warehouse solution. The project leverages core data warehousing principles and tools, with an emphasis on **Teradata** for ETL processes and data management. It covers stages from data source identification to creating interactive dashboards for in-depth analysis.

## 1. Data Warehouse Architecture
   - **Architecture Description**:  
     An overview of the architecture, incorporating components such as ETL processes, data modeling, and data integration.
   - **ETL Processes**:  
     Utilizes **Teradata BTEQ** (Basic Teradata Query) for efficient extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data. This includes data cleansing, transformation logic, and integration from various sources into the data warehouse.

## 2. Design and Implementation
   - **Data Modeling Techniques**:  
     In-depth discussion on data modeling strategies including normalization, designing dimensions and fact tables, and building hierarchies for optimized data retrieval.
   - **ETL Implementation**:  
     The ETL implementation utilizes **Teradata BTEQ** scripts to map data into the data warehouse model, applying necessary transformations and ensuring data integrity throughout the pipeline.

## Technologies Used
   - **Teradata BTEQ**:  
     A key tool in this project for executing efficient ETL operations, ensuring seamless integration and processing of large datasets within Teradata environments.
